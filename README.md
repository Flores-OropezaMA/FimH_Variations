## README.

This repository contain the sequences and documents associated with the FimH variations analysis, that will be published by the name of "Polymorphisms identification in the FimH adhesine of UPEC: Colonization and virulence effect in HTB-5 human bladder cells"

-   FimH_Variations: Root Directory.

-   data: Directory with the folders

    -   genomes

        -   \*.txt: CDS FASTA sequences of the genomes use in this study

        -   GeneSearch.sh: Script that allows to search the gen "FimH" in the \*.txt files in the same rute, and create a output directory with a file called "FimH-bp.txt.
